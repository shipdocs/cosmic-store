WIP COSMIC Store

Fork of POP OS cosmic store
-adds search filtering based on number of downloads (popularity).
-adds wayland compatibility indicators. The compatiblity indicators are a best effort as not enough data is available. Includes filtering search results on expected compatibility.
 But since there is a new focus in the community to update and maintain meta data for flathub, this should improve over time, it at least give an informed idea if an application will work well.
 In the end maintainers should have an incentive to update meta, meta is nice to have for the community.
-Cleaned up all/much warnings, unused code etc, no linting errors or build warnings/errors.
-Working on chewing up main.rs to a managable file instead of keeping it a god file.
